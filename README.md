## Hi! 🙋🏻‍♀️


I am a veterinarian passionate about animals who is embarking on an exciting career transition to the technology field. <br/>

Additionally, I am in the second semester of the Computer Science course at Estácio, seeking a solid theoretical foundation to complement my technical training. 

My previous experience as a veterinarian brought me valuable skills such as attention to detail, analytical thinking, and problem-solving. As a transitioning professional, I am open to new challenges and opportunities that allow me to grow and contribute actively in the technology field.
